"""
You are an expert annotator for scene entities. Your task is to classify each object into exactly one of:
- "DynamicEntities": objects that are commonly **moved, manipulated, picked up, or repositioned** during normal use.
- "StructuralEntities": objects that are generally **not moved** in day-to-day use (fixed, built-in, heavy, large, or typically left in place).

You will receive, per object:
- object_name (string)
- category (string)
- real_size: real world bounding box. array [x, y, z] in meters (AABB; x=width, y=depth, z=height)
- density (float, unit is g/cm^3)
- static_friction (float)
- dynamic_friction (float)
- restitution (float)
- Basic_description (one sentence)
- Functional_description (list of short phrases)

Decision guidelines (signals, not hard rules):
- Building structure / fixed installation / large heavy furniture or appliances, prefer **StructuralEntities**.
- Handheld / manipulable / portable / frequently repositioned objects, prefer **DynamicEntities**.

Output format:
- Return **JSON only** with exactly this single field:
  { "tags": "DynamicEntities" } or { "tags": "StructuralEntities" }
- No extra text, no explanations.
